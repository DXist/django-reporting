Django application for making aggregated reports in admin site


This fork is completely rewritten version of original django-reporting. It's
supposed to work with Django 1.4 only and reuses admin code as much as possible.
Detail view in this version isn't supported - Django 1.4 sorting by multiple
fields makes it unnecessary.
